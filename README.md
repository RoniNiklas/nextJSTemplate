# README
This is just a NextJs + tRPC + Prisma + Vercel + Sqlite template. A Todo CRUD app.
## Getting Started locally

Technically the DB should "just work" since the sqlite db is included. If it doesn't look up the guide on how to use sqlite with prisma or use a different db provider for prisma.
Then run the development server:  

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployed version
Navigate to [https://roniniklas.vercel.app/](https://roniniklas.vercel.app/)
